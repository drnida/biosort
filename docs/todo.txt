Eventually it'd be lovely if we could break the python code
into 5 files:
    1) file i/o
        -This would handle populating c-files with the array to be sorted
        -This would also handle logging results out and handing opcounts off to
        tournament operation - mav
    2) gene modification
        -specifically for single mutations and the algorithms that select
         what to mutate
    3) tournament operation
    4) UI menu - mav
        -For user input
    5) Gene creation - mav
        -this would include all the template code and would be invoked
         when a new gene needed to be created (rather than a point mutation)

Point mutation needs to consider:
    If a - + * / or % changes to an N the opcount for the file
    needs to decrement by one.
    If N changes to - + * / or % the opcount needs to increment.

    If point mutation rolls up a 'g' it needs to figure out which one
    and hand control to something else to decide whether to delete,
    copy or generate a new gene.

We need to decide what we want to be able to change when we start the
overall program 
Some must-haves:
    Runs per generation
    Generations per simulation
    Number of breeders per generation
    Number of offspring per breeder
Some it'd-be-nices:
    Number of mutations per offspring (currently default == 1)
    Number of permament random per generation
We should also consider how we want to select these parameters.  I
feel like a basic menu is the simplest (command line arguments would
require an instruction manual).

Develop replacement algorithm for the tournament.  This includes:
    -How many ops should constitute a time-out for an organism.
        - I liked the worst of the 3 best +20% -mav
    -Should the time-out ops change as winners are crowned?
    -Should the time-out ops == worst winners raw value?
        - I think it should be based off worst winner in last generation's average or worst time -mav
    -Should any of this be specifiable at run-time?
        - It might be best for the sake of keeping our variables constant if we only change it between gens -mav
