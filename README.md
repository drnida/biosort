Self Generating Sorting Algorithm

Regular updates are hard.  The program is currently being refined, but is fully operational.
A number of test runs indicate a marked improvement in efficiency of C++ programs over time
with selective pressure applied.  Next step: some sort of GUI for ease of use, and addressing
bottlenecking. -jws

Python can successfully write a c++ program, compile it, run it and report its success/failure.
The program is invoked by running the biosort.sh shell script in the main biosort directory.
We are very close to being able to actually run full simulations.
TODO:
    Mike: Work on tournament implementation.  Set variables in python based on config file.
    Daniel: Write array randomizer for arbitarily-sized array.
    Dean: Format config file and read values in from it.
    John: Shifts (fml).
