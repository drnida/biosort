Python can successfully write a c++ program, compile it, run it and report its success/failure.
The program is invoked by running the biosort.sh shell script in the main biosort directory.
We are very close to being able to actually run full simulations.
TODO:
    Mike: Work on tournament implementation.  Set variables in python based on config file.
    Daniel: Write array randomizer for arbitarily-sized array.
    Dean: Format config file and read values in from it.
    John: Shifts (fml).
